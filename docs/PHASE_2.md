# Phase 2: Graphics Layer

## Goal

Build the browser-based rendering foundation for the TypeScript port using Babylon.js, while keeping the rendering layer isolated from gameplay and state logic.

Phase 2 should establish the renderer, basic scene and camera setup, minimal texture and mesh primitives, sprite support, and the first runtime asset-loading foundation. This is a targeted graphics milestone rather than a full conversion of all rendering subsystems.

---

## 2.1 Babylon.js Scene Setup

Create the core rendering abstraction:

    src/
      graphics/
        RenderEngine.ts

Responsibilities:

- Create and own the Babylon.js `Engine`
- Create and own the Babylon.js `Scene`
- Configure the rendering canvas
- Configure the camera
- Set up basic lighting
- Configure shadows where required
- Provide the render/update entry points
- Keep Babylon.js-specific implementation details inside the graphics layer

Initial shape:

```typescript
class RenderEngine {
  engine: Babylon.Engine;
  scene: Babylon.Scene;
  camera: Babylon.Camera;

  constructor(canvas: HTMLCanvasElement) {
    this.engine = new Babylon.Engine(canvas, true);
    this.scene = new Babylon.Scene(this.engine);
    // Setup lighting, shadows, post-processing
  }
}
````

### Acceptance Criteria

* A Babylon.js engine can be created from the application's canvas.
* A scene is created successfully.
* A camera is configured and can render the scene.
* The renderer can render a minimal test scene in the browser.
* Rendering responsibilities are not mixed into game-state or entity classes.
* The implementation remains scoped to the runtime shell and graphics layer, without attempting a full game-world conversion in the same step.

---

## 2.2 Rendering Systems

Port the existing rendering concepts into Babylon.js abstractions.

### Texture Rendering

Add the Babylon.js texture layer needed for the app shell and future sprite work:

* `Texture`
* `DynamicTexture`

The initial goal is to support the minimal rendering operations required by the port, rather than a full one-to-one replacement of every legacy GPU abstraction.

### Mesh Rendering

Use Babylon.js meshes for the basic scene setup:

* ground or placeholder meshes
* simple primitive geometry
* materials
* transforms

The first implementation should favour correctness and a clear abstraction over premature optimization.

### Sprite Rendering

Support sprites through billboards or plane-based sprites where needed:

* sprite textures
* sprite positioning
* scaling
* rotation where required
* texture regions / atlas coordinates
* camera-facing billboards where appropriate

This should be treated as an incremental renderer capability, not a full port of the entire legacy sprite pipeline in the same step.

### Shader Rendering

Use Babylon.js `ShaderMaterial` where custom effects are required.

The abstraction should make it possible to add custom shaders without leaking shader-specific details into unrelated game code.

### HUD / GUI

Keep the game HUD separate from world rendering.

Initial options:

* Babylon GUI
* DOM/CSS overlay

The implementation should make it possible to replace the UI approach later without rewriting the renderer.

---

## 2.3 Asset Pipeline

Create:

```
src/
  assets/
    AssetLoader.ts
```

The asset loader should provide a single entry point for loading runtime resources.

Responsibilities:

* Resolve runtime asset paths
* Load textures
* Load sprite sheets
* Load model/mesh data
* Cache loaded resources
* Avoid loading the same resource multiple times

For Phase 2, original GTA1 binary parsing should be treated as future work unless it is explicitly required by the current milestone. The loader should support a manifest-based runtime path model and placeholder asset integration without blocking the renderer.

Runtime assets should live under:

```
public/
  assets/
    textures/
    models/
    sounds/
    music/
    shaders/
```

Keep the source asset organization predictable and avoid coupling game code to individual file paths.

### Asset Path Requirements

Runtime paths should remain relative to the deployed app so the project works cleanly across a GitHub Pages URL or a custom domain.

Example:

```typescript
const texturePath = './assets/textures/vehicles/car.png';
```

Avoid root-relative runtime paths such as:

```typescript
'/assets/textures/vehicles/car.png'
```

This is a deployment concern and should not be treated as the main implementation focus of the graphics milestone.

---

## 2.4 Camera and GTA1 View

The initial camera direction should support:

* (must have) stable camera orientation
* (nice to have) configurable zoom
* (nice to have) configurable camera position
* (must have) camera behavior isolated from gameplay entities

The project should prefer a clear, data-driven camera abstraction over hard-coded object behavior.

---

## 2.5 Rendering Architecture

The graphics layer should remain independent from the rest of the engine as much as practical.

Target architecture:

```
GameEngine
    |
    +-- RenderEngine
    |     +-- Scene
    |     +-- Camera
    |     +-- Materials
    |     +-- Meshes
    |     +-- Sprites
    |     +-- Shaders
    |
    +-- AssetLoader
```

The renderer should expose game-oriented operations rather than requiring gameplay code to manipulate Babylon.js directly wherever possible.

For example:

```typescript
renderEngine.createSprite(...);
renderEngine.createMesh(...);
renderEngine.setCamera(...);
renderEngine.render();
```

This keeps the future option of changing rendering implementation without rewriting gameplay systems, while staying within the actual scope of the current milestone.

---

## 2.6 Integration With the Game Loop

Phase 2 should establish the rendering side of the main engine loop without overcommitting to full gameplay behavior.

Target flow:

```
Input
  ↓
Game State
  ↓
World / Entities
  ↓
Render State
  ↓
RenderEngine
  ↓
Babylon.js Scene
  ↓
Canvas
```

The immediate goal is a clean rendering integration path, while gameplay systems remain intentionally separate and are expected to evolve in later phases.

The renderer should expose enough functionality for the application to:

1. Initialize the rendering engine.
2. Load required graphical resources.
3. Create a scene.
4. Create the camera.
5. Create test geometry/sprites.
6. Render each frame.
7. Resize correctly when the browser viewport changes.

---

## 2.7 Browser and Canvas Requirements

The rendering layer must behave correctly as a browser game.

Requirements:

* Canvas fills the available viewport.
* Browser page scrolling is disabled during gameplay.
* Canvas resizes with the window.
* Rendering remains responsive across common desktop resolutions.
* Pointer/touch interaction can be supported by later input systems.
* Fullscreen rendering should remain possible.

The renderer should not depend on a fixed canvas resolution.

---

## 2.8 Performance Considerations

Do not optimize prematurely, but establish boundaries that allow optimization later.

Initial considerations:

* Reuse meshes and materials where possible.
* Cache loaded textures.
* Avoid recreating Babylon objects every frame.
* Keep asset loading asynchronous.
* Avoid unnecessary draw calls.
* Keep sprite rendering batched where practical.
* Leave room for object pooling in later phases.

Advanced optimization such as texture compression, lazy loading, and LOD belongs primarily to the later optimization phase.

---

## 2.9 Phase 2 Deliverables

By the end of Phase 2, the project should have:

* [ ] Babylon.js installed and configured.
* [ ] A working `RenderEngine`.
* [ ] A Babylon.js scene.
* [ ] An orthographic/isometric-style camera.
* [ ] Basic lighting and shadow configuration.
* [ ] Texture loading.
* [ ] Basic mesh creation.
* [ ] Sprite rendering.
* [ ] ShaderMaterial support.
* [ ] Initial HUD/GUI integration point.
* [ ] An `AssetLoader` abstraction.
* [ ] Runtime asset directories under `public/assets/`.
* [ ] Asset caching.
* [ ] Browser resize handling.
* [ ] A minimal rendered test scene.
* [ ] Rendering integrated with the application lifecycle.

---

## 2.10 Acceptance Test

Phase 2 is complete when the application can:

1. Start the Babylon.js rendering engine.
2. Create a scene and orthographic camera.
3. Load a texture through the asset loader.
4. Display a textured sprite or mesh.
5. Render the scene continuously.
6. Resize correctly with the browser window.
7. Use relative asset paths.
8. Keep renderer implementation isolated from game logic.
9. Run successfully through the project's normal TypeScript/build workflow.

---

## Migration Notes

The TypeScript port should preserve the existing game's rendering concepts where they are useful, but should not reproduce the C++/OpenGL API literally.

The target is a browser-friendly rendering architecture:

* OpenGL → Babylon.js
* GpuTexture2D → Babylon Texture / DynamicTexture
* TrimeshBuffer → Babylon Mesh + vertex/index buffers
* Sprite2D → billboard/plane-based sprites
* GLSL shaders → Babylon ShaderMaterial
* Dear ImGui rendering → Babylon GUI or DOM/CSS overlay

The graphics layer should be designed around the needs of the TypeScript game rather than around a one-to-one translation of the original implementation.

---

## Phase 2 Milestone

**Expected milestone: Week 7**

At the end of this phase, sprites and textures should display correctly in a Babylon.js scene and the project should have the rendering/asset foundation required for the Physics & Input phase.

---

## Next Phase

Phase 3 will build on this rendering foundation by introducing:

* physics integration
* vehicle and character rigid bodies
* keyboard/mouse/gamepad input
* the input manager
* physics/render synchronization
